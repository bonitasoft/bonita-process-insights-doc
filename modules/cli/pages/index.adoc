== Export data

=== Configuration

Before exporting, you need to configure the connection to the Bonita Instance from which you want to export the data.

Export tool can support two type of databases Postgresql and Oracle. The jdbc url must be adapted according to the type of database you will use. 

* **Oracle** :    

[source,yaml]
----
jdbc-url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@${bonita.database.host}:${bonita.database.port}/${bonita.database.name}?oracle.net.disableOob=true`jdbc-url`
----

* **PostgresSql** : 

[source,yaml]
----
jdbc-url: jdbc:postgresql://${bonita.database.host}:${bonita.database.port}/${bonita.database.name}
----

[NOTE]
====
After you finish to configure your file, place it next to the executable jar directory or in a subdirectory named config.

=== Exporting data and Importing to BPI

To export your data, use the following command line :
`pi-cli bonita export`

You can add some arguments like `--output` to specify the exact path of the exported zip file. 

=== Anonymize exported data

By default, your exported data will be anonymized. It's possible to deactivate the anonymization or adding your own configuration.
