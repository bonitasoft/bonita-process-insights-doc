== Glossary

=== Business Goals
Before exporting, you need to configure the connection to the Bonita Instance from which you want to export the data.

=== Cases
This is an instance of a process

=== Flownode
A Flow Node in BPMN is an element within a process that represents a point in the flow where something happens.
It can be an activity that needs to be performed, a decision point, an event that occurs, or a gateway that dictates the flow's path based on certain conditions.
Flow Nodes are interconnected by Sequence Flows, which determine the order in which activities are executed in the process.
Type of flownodes:

* **Events**
* **Activities**
* **Events Gateways**
