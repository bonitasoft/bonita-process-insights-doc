:description: An explanation of what the Bonita Process Insights Dashboards are.


== Introduction to BPI Dashboards?

This section describes our two powerful dashboards to enhance your process analysis capabilities.
The Process Overview Analysis dashboard offers a comprehensive view of individual processes, enabling detailed performance tracking and identification of bottlenecks.
The Process Comparison dashboard allows for side-by-side analysis of two processes, facilitating benchmarking and optimization.
Dive into these dashboards to unlock deeper insights and drive efficiency in your workflows.


=== Dashboard overview
The Overview Dashboard is a powerful tool for gaining deep visibility into business processes, monitoring performance and driving continuous improvement initiatives.

Whether you're a process owner, analyst, or executive, this dashboard equips you with the insights you need to optimize processes and achieve operational excellence.

==== Glossary

*Variant:* A specific version or pathway of a business process within an organization.

*Temporal Objectives:* Pre-set time constraints within which a process is expected to be completed.

*Average Duration:* The arithmetic mean time taken to complete a process variant, measured across all cases.

*Standard Deviation:* A statistical measure of the dispersion or variability from the average duration; a low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean.

*Case:* An instance of a process execution.

*Flow Nodes:* Individual steps, tasks, or actions that comprise a business process.

*Objective Failure Rate:* The proportion of process instances that did not meet the established temporal objectives.

*Unassigned User Flow Nodes:* Process steps that have not been assigned to any user or role within the system, which could lead to process execution delays.

*Case Start Date:* The timestamp marking the initiation of a process case.

*Root Process Definition:* The original process template from which variations may be derived.

*Root Case Id:* The identifier for the initiating process case in a chain of related cases.

*Process Definition:* The specific configuration or edition of the process being examined.

*Case Id:* A unique identifier for an individual instance of a process.

*Process Duration Objective:* The predefined maximum duration allowed for a case to be completed.

*Case Duration:* The total elapsed time from the start to the conclusion of a case.

*Flow Nodes Count:* The count of discrete steps or actions within the process case.

*Case State:* The current phase or status of the case, such as 'Completed' or 'In Progress'.

*Started By:* The user or automated system that initiated the case.

*Case Objective Status:* The success or failure of the case in meeting the duration objective.
