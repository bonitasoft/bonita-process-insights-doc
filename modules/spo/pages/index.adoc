== Overview
Smart Process Overview (SPO) harnesses the power of AI to provide a concise yet insightful summary of your process execution and performance. 
It delivers clear, actionable insights into your business processes, empowering you to make informed decisions with ease. 

With the Smart Process Overview, you gain a comprehensive perspective on your operations. 
Monitor performance at a glance, evaluate team effectiveness, and quickly identify areas requiring attention through user-friendly reports—designed for both beginners and experienced users.

Every time you import data on Bonita Process Insights, you can choose whether to generate a Smart Process Overview for your data. 
If enabled, the SPO is automatically sent to the email distribution list specified in your application's settings. 
Additionally, you can generate the SPO on demand via your application card.

== FAQ

=== What AI model is used to generate the Smart Process Overview?

The SPO is powered by OpenAI.

 
=== How is the Smart Process Overview computed?

The SPO analyzes data from the last three months based on the most recent date in your dataset. For example, if your imported data ends on November 15, the SPO will cover November, October, and September.


=== What can I expect in terms of data privacy?

Smart Process Overview leverages OpenAI's APIs to deliver its functionalities. Any data sent to OpenAI is governed by their privacy policy, which you can review https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/[here]. 
For organizations with stringent privacy requirements, we suggest to xref:cli:configuration-for-anonymization.adoc[anonymize your imported data] first for maximum privacy. 

Rest assured, the SPO relies on computed KPIs such as wait times and failed processes—not raw data. Nothing is sent to OpenAI without your explicit consent.


=== I have imported datasets and I have an email configured in my application, yet I haven’t received anything

Smart Process Overview delivery may take a few hours. Check your spam folder or try again later. If the issue persists, contact our https://csc.bonitacloud.bonitasoft.com/apps/CustomerServices/supportGuide/[Support team].


=== I have imported data while not having any email configured in my application, can I still generate a Smart Process Overview afterwards?

Yes. Simply configure an email in your application, return to the home page and click the SPO star button on the application card.
