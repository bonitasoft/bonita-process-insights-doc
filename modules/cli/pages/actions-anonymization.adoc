= Actions types for anonymization
:description: Describe all possible actions for anonymization
:javase-javadoc-base-url: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api

== Overview

Action types are mechanisms used to anonymize specific values in the exported data. A value can have one or multiple actions associated with it.
If no actions are explicitly specified in the configuration for a particular value, it will default to a predefined action as described in the page
xref:configuration-for-anonymization.adoc[How-to configure anonymization with the CLI].

Additionally, you can define a fallback mechanism in case the primary action does not work or does not find a match (for example, using the `REGEX_REPLACE` action).

=== Order of execution of the actions

The actions are executed in the order they are defined in the configuration file. The order of the actions is important because the output of one action is the input of the next action.
The fallback action is executed only if none of the defined actions match.

In the given example, two actions are applied to the `content` column of the `arch_process_comment` table. The first action, `REGEX_REPLACE`, preserves the domain of an email while replacing the remaining parts. The second action substitutes a username (such as walter.bates) with +++*****+++. +
If neither of these actions match, the fallback action `REMOVE_LINE` is executed, resulting in the removal of the entire line.

[source,yaml]
----
arch_process_comment:
    content:
      actions:
        - action: REGEX_REPLACE
          pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9._-]+(@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)
          value: '***$1'
        - action: REGEX_REPLACE
          pattern: ( [a-zA-Z0-9_\-]*\.[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]* )
          value: '*****'
    fallback:
      action: REMOVE_LINE
      where:
        - column: content
          regex: '.*'
----

=== Where conditions

It is possible to define `where` conditions on an action, The where conditions refers to column of the same table (no cross table conditions). The action will be performed if a where condition in the conditions list match. This can be translated as an `OR` operator between conditions: Apply this action if col x match regex 1  OR col x match regex 1 OR col y match regex 2 OR ... 

== Available actions

=== HASH

Replace the values by a Hash, this allows to remove readable values but keeps the cardinality. Safe hash function should be used ( SHA-256 for instance )

*Usage* : Value containing sensitive information but on which you want to have accurate statistic and the ability to see the impact on the process execution.

*Parameters* :

*value* : the algorithm to use for hashing. Optional, default to SHA-512

Sample configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
arch_process_instance:
  stringindex1:
    actions:
      - action: hash
        value: SHA-256
----

=== REPLACE

Replace the value with a specified value ( which can be empty )

*Usage* : Value containing sensitive information you want to hide.

*Parameters* :

*value* : The value used to replace the current field. Default value empty

Sample configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
arch_flownode_instance:
  displayname:
    actions:
      - action: REPLACE
        value: 'hidden'
----

=== REPLACE_WITH_OTHER

Replace a value by the value of another column of the same table and line.

*Usage* : Value containing sensitive information you want to replace with another non sensitive meaningful value in the same table.

*Parameters* :

*value* : column name of the column to be use to replace the value.  No Default , mandatory

Sample configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
arch_flownode_instance:
  displayname:
    actions:
      - action: REPLACE_WITH_OTHER
        value: name
----

=== REGEX_REPLACE

Replace the value if the regexp match and use the matching group to create the new value.

[TIP]
====
The pattern is a regular expression using the {javase-javadoc-base-url}/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum[Java Pattern syntax] that is used to match the value. The value is the replacement pattern (including captured group) that is used to change the value.

* If several parts of the value match, they are all replaced. The behavior is similar to that of the Java {javase-javadoc-base-url}/java.base/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#replaceAll(java.lang.String)[Matcher.replaceAll] method.
* If none of the regexps match, a fallback can be configured, which can be any other action.
====

*Usage* : Value containing some sensitive information with other non-sensitive one, and you want to keep the non-sensitive information.

*Parameters* :

*pattern* : The regular expression to match  Default , mandatory

*value* : The replacement pattern ( including captured group ) to used to change the value. No Default , mandatory

*fallback* : action to apply if no regexp match.

Sample configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
arch_process_comment:
  content:
    actions:
      - action: REGEX_REPLACE
        pattern: contract (\d+) is ready for user (\S+)\.(\S+)
        value: contract XXXX is ready for $2
      - action: REGEX_REPLACE
        pattern: The task Allocate repair agent on car (\S+) (is now assigned to .*)
        value: The task Allocate repair agent on car *** $2
    fallback:
      - action: REPLACE
        value: hidden comment
----

This action can be useful for comments, descriptions or free text like data. It let you mask such things as emails, usernames or logins with a specific pattern and so on. Because you can define a list of regex action in a specific order, you can chain regex replacements to break anonymization in smaller sucessive replacements and thus simpler regex.

=== KEEP

Keep the value, no anonymization done.

*Parameters*: none

Sample configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
arch_flownode_instance:
  displayname:
    actions:
      - action: KEEP
----

=== REMOVE_LINE

Remove the whole data row if the column value matches the given regex pattern.

In the example below, we remove all lines of `arch_contract_data` where column `name` has a value that match regex `PurchasedLicenseInput\.bypassSysDate` or `PurchasedLicenseInput\.caseCounterStartDate`

Sample configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
arch_contract_data:
  val:
    actions:
    - action: REMOVE_LINE
      where:
      - column: name
        regex: PurchasedLicenseInput\.bypassSysDate
      - column: name
        regex: PurchasedLicenseInput\.caseCounterStartDate
