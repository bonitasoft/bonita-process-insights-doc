== Section 1: Chart Analysis

=== Cases Objective Status (pie chart)

*Description*: This chart provides a visual representation of the proportion of cases that have met their objectives versus those that have not.

*Purpose*: To give stakeholders an immediate sense of process success rates and highlight areas requiring attention.

=== Cases Ended Over Time (Bar Graph)

*Description*: This graph illustrates the number of cases concluded over a selected time period, differentiated by whether they have met their objectives.

*Purpose*: To track and analyze the flow of process completion over time, identifying any patterns or irregularities.

== Section 2: Metrics and KPI analysis

=== Process Definition Metrics

*Description*: Lists all the processes by their unique identifiers and provides a snapshot of their current status.

*Metrics Included*:

* Process Name: The name of the process being executed.
* Root Process Definition: Indicates the originating process from which a given subprocess derives.
* Duration Objective: Targeted time for process completion.

=== Performance Metrics

*Description*: These metrics provide a deeper dive into the performance and efficiency of each process.

*Metrics and KPIs Included*:

* Duration (Avg): The average time taken for a process to complete.
* Duration (Standard Deviation): The variability of the process duration from the average.
* Cases: The count of process instances.
* Successful Completion %: The percentage of processes that met their objectives successfully.

=== Cases with Objectives (Table)

*Description*: A table that outlines specific data on cases that failed to meet objectives, providing a granular view of performance issues.

*Purpose*: To allow managers to quickly identify and prioritize issues for process improvement.

=== Additional Functional Elements

*Description*: Describes the functionality of additional elements such as filters, search, export options, and settings.

*Purpose*: To enable users to customize and interact with the dashboard for specific analytical needs.

== Process Variants Analysis

image::process-variant.png[Process variant]

=== Introduction

This documentation delves into the analysis of business process variants using the BPM dashboard metrics, focusing on adherence to temporal objectives—predefined maximum durations for process execution.
The document aims to elucidate the performance of each variant and provide actionable insights.

=== Dashboard Analysis

==== Variants

The individual business processes monitored for performance, each with a distinct sequence of tasks and expected outcomes.

==== Temporal Objectives

Indicates whether the process variants are completed within the target duration set for the process, with a specific focus on the percentage of cases meeting these temporal objectives.

==== Average Duration

Reflects the mean time taken for a process variant to reach completion across all instances.

==== Standard Deviation of Duration

Quantifies the variation in process duration from the mean, indicating consistency or variability in process execution time.

==== Cases

The count of process instances for each variant within the observed timeframe.

==== Flow Nodes per Cases

Average number of distinct steps or actions that a case goes through in its lifecycle.

==== Objective Failure Rate

Percentage of cases that did not meet the established temporal objectives.

==== Unassigned User Flow Nodes

Indicates the frequency of process steps that lack designated user responsibility, which could lead to delays and inefficiency.

=== Detailed Analysis

==== High Objective Failure Rates

The 'Update Case Data -> Create new Support Case via Web' variant has a notably high failure rate (61.9%), significantly exceeding its temporal objectives. This suggests a critical need for process reevaluation.

==== Process Execution Time

Variants with extended average durations and high standard deviations are prone to be inconsistent with their temporal objectives. These may require streamlining or additional resources to improve time efficiency.

==== Complexity and User Assignment

Variants with numerous flow nodes may be inherently complex, affecting the execution time. Furthermore, instances of unassigned user flow nodes could indicate unclear process ownership, contributing to delays.

==== Recommendations

* Conduct a root cause analysis for variants failing temporal objectives, such as the 'Update Case Data' variant, to identify and rectify inefficiencies.
* Standardize and possibly automate parts of the process to reduce the standard deviation in process duration, thereby increasing predictability and consistency.
* Review and clarify user responsibilities for all flow nodes to ensure accountability and minimize unassigned tasks.

==== Conclusion

The BPM dashboard offers critical insights into the efficiency and timeliness of business process variants.
By monitoring these metrics against temporal objectives, organizations can target improvements to enhance overall process performance.
This documentation is now more aligned with the importance of meeting temporal objectives and includes a xref: application/pages/index.adoc[Glossary] to help clarify technical ssary to help clarify technical terms.
For actual implementation, a detailed process audit and analysis would be required.

== Cases

image::cases.png[Cases]

=== Introduction

This document provides a detailed overview of individual business process cases as represented in the BPM dashboard.
The focus is on the performance of each case with respect to the temporal objectives, which are predetermined time frames for process completion.

==== Dashboard Data Points

*Case Start Date*: The date and time when the case was initiated.

*Root Process Definition*: The fundamental process template or blueprint from which the case was created.

*Root Case Id*: The unique identifier for the primary case associated with the process.

*Process Definition*: The specific definition or version of the process being executed.

*Case Id*: The unique identifier for the specific instance of the process.

*Process Duration Objective*: The target time frame within which the process is expected to be completed.

*Case Duration*: The actual time taken from the start to the completion of the case.

*Case State*: The current status of the case (e.g., Completed, In Progress, etc.).

*Started By*: The individual or entity that initiated the case.

*Case Objective Status*: Indicates whether the case was completed within the temporal objectives (success or failed).

==== Detailed Analysis

*Adherence to Temporal Objectives*

The 'Case Objective Status' column is crucial in determining the efficiency of process executions.
Any case with a 'failed' status indicate a breach of the temporal objectives, warranting further investigation.

*Case Duration Insights*

Comparing 'Case Duration' against 'Process Duration Objective' provides insights into process efficiency and the effectiveness of time management within cases.

*Identification of Patterns*

Recurring 'failed' statuses in cases with the same 'Root Process Definition' may point to systemic issues in specific process templates.

*Recommendations*

* For cases exceeding the 'Process Duration Objective', conduct a detailed review to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
* Investigate any commonalities among failed cases, such as process definitions or starters, to pinpoint areas for process optimization.

==== Conclusion

The "Cases" tab of the BPM dashboard provides a granular view of process execution against temporal objectives.
Through meticulous tracking and analysis, organizations can improve their process management strategies and enhance overall performance.
